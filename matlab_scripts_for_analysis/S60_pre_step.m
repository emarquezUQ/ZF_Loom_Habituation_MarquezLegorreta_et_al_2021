
%%%% this script is to explore the responses of the S60 fish.

%%% First it is taking the resutls from the CNMF (caiman). 
%%% Then it does a first exploration of the dataset with a kmeans to see
%%% possible types of respones and their distribution across fish and
%%% planes. We check how they look, which slices and which fish
%%% they are in and then select the ones that are in most fish.
%%% We then used a linear regression to look for the ROIs with the selected
%%% proiles and clean them from noisy responses. 
%%% Finally we tested with a second kmeans to the filtered datasets to see
%%% if other respones were discovered. 

%%% Note: these are denoised traces, we found later that adding the noise
%%% allowed us to detect the inhibited responses and details on other
%%% profiles. But this first analysis was useful to know the main type of
%%% responses and generate regressors.

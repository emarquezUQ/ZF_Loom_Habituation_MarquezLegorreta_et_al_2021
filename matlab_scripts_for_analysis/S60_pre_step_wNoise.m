%%%%% adding the noise filtered out by the CNMF

%%% First it is taking the resutls from the CNMF (caiman). 
%%% Then it does a first exploration of the dataset with a kmeans to see
%%% possible types of respones and their distribution across fish and
%%% planes. 
%%% Finally we tested with a second kmeans  
%%% with a higher number of clusters to see
%%% if other respones were discovered.
